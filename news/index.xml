This study , led by Alex Connolly, uses a deep neural network (DNN) to improve turbulence modeling by predicting these forces in large-eddy simulations (LES) of the atmospheric boundary layer. The DNN is trained on high-resolution data and tested across different conditions. Results show that models using physics-based scaling perform better than those relying only on statistical normalization. Embedding physical symmetries into the model further improves accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Learning Propagators for Sea Surface Height Forecasts Using Koopman Autoencoders</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2503brettin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2503brettin/</guid><description>Sea surface height forecasts are influenced by many uncertainties.

The geographical patterns of the forced SST seasonal cycle change reveal two notable features: an increase in mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, which is associated with alterations in mixed-layer depth, and a robust dipole pattern in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, primarily driven by changes in surface winds.</description></item><item><title>Neural general circulation models for weather and climate</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2410yuval/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2410yuval/</guid><description>General circulation models (GCMs) are essential for weather and climate prediction. They use physics-based simulations to model large-scale dynamics and small-scale processes. Recently, machine-learning models have matched or exceeded GCMs in weather forecasting accuracy, but struggled with long-term stability and ensemble forecasts. In this Nature paper , co-led by Janni Yuval, a new model, NeuralGCM, integrates machine learning with a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics. It performs as well as top machine-learning and physics-based methods for short-term forecasts and can track climate metrics accurately for decades with prescribed sea surface temperature.</description></item><item><title>Distilling Machine Learning’s Added Value</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2410shamekh/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2410shamekh/</guid><description>This project addresses the challenge of explaining the added value of machine learning in weather and climate models, particularly for complex deep learning models.

Researchers, including Laure Zanna and CliMA members, reduced this uncertainty by linking AMOC strength to the meridional density difference and overturning depth. They found that models with a deeper present-day overturning predict greater weakening due to less stratified North Atlantic waters. Using observational data, they estimate a modest AMOC weakening of about 4 Sv by century&amp;rsquo;s end, regardless of emissions.</description></item><item><title>Bringing Statistics to Storylines!</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2408gorman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2408gorman/</guid><description>Accurately modeling extreme weather events is a major goal in climate science and weather risk management. High-resolution computational models provide precise data but are costly for capturing rare events. This study focuses on localized, short-lived events like heavy precipitation. The researchers, including Paul O’Gorman, developed a more efficient method for sampling these events by combining adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) and “ensemble boosting.” The new approach, tested on the Lorenz-96 model, improved the sampling of extreme events by a factor of 10.</description></item><item><title>Sampling Hybrid Climate Simulation at Scale</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2407gentine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2407gentine/</guid><description>Machine-learning (ML) models could enhance climate simulations by accurately representing small-scale processes like turbulence and convection.

By incorporating a physics-based constraint this approach allows us to decompose the total vertical flux into two main modes of variability based on large scale forces that control the turbulence in the atmosphere.</description></item><item><title>Parameterizing vertical mixing coefficients in the Ocean by Akash Sane</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2307sane/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2307sane/</guid><description>Small scale vertical mixing processes in the upper ocean region cannot be resolved by ocean models due to the lack of computing resources, and are thus parameterized. Existing models have a few ad hoc approximations which cause uncertainty in climate change simulations. In this breakthrough preprint , Aakash Sane and co-authors - Brandon Reichl, Alistair Adcroft, and Laure Zanna - replace such an approximation using data driven neural networks (NN), leading to improved physics in an ocean model simulation and a reduction of model bias in the Tropics.</description></item><item><title>Smart correction model for winter sky temperatures by Lorenzo Zampieri</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2306zampieri/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2306zampieri/</guid><description>This study , led by Lorenzo Zampieri, and co-authored by Marika Holland, illustrates a novel method based on machine learning for reducing the systematic surface temperature errors that characterize multiple atmospheric reanalyses in sea-ice-covered regions of the Arctic under clear-sky conditions. The corrected reanalysis temperature can be employed to support polar research activities, and in particular to better simulate the evolution of the interacting sea ice and ocean system within numerical models.</description></item><item><title>Data-driven subgrid parameterizations by Karl Otness</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2305otness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2305otness/</guid><description>In this ongoing project , Karl Otness and co-authors are evaluating a proof of concept multiscale approach to predicting subgrid forcings in climate models. They see encouraging preliminary results from first making a prediction in a fine-to-coarse direction which yields a lower resolution, but more confident prediction followed by a refinement to predict finer scale details.

This work has 3 important implications: 1) a daily freeboard product allows them, for the first time, to assess radar freeboard (and ultimately sea ice thickness) variability on sub-weekly timescales &amp;ndash; it takes up to 1 month for each satellite to generate pan-Arctic coverage alone.</description></item><item><title> s2s challenge</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/s2schallenge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/s2schallenge/</guid><description>M²LInES PI Judith Berner is setting up a team to participate to the s2s challenge, which goal is to improve sub-seasonal to seasonal predictions using AI.
