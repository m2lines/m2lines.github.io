We will diagnose small-scale physical processes from high-resolution simulations and observational data. Those processes cannot be captured by traditional models, which operate on a bigger scale. In particular we will be focusing on:
Atmospheric convection and clouds (O&amp;rsquo;Gorman) Atmospheric boundary layer processes at the ocean and sea-ice interface (Gentine) Ocean mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (Abernathey) Ocean submesoscale processes (LeSommer) Ocean mesoscale momentum, energy and air-sea interactions (Zanna) Vertical mixing (Adcroft/Reichl) Learn more: Come discover Pangeo Forge and how it can help us solve complex problems in climate and weather research here with Ryan Abernathey, head of big data at M²LInES.</description></item><item><title>Johanna Goldman</title><link>/team/johannagoldman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>/team/johannagoldman/</guid><description>NYU, Courant Institute

Learning from the high resolution data as well as from model errors (Data Assimilation Increments) we will develop Machine Learning algorithms that are physics- and scale-aware.
Our transformative methodology will rely on a range of ML algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks, equation-discovery), including with strict physical constraints, or with embeded physics for improved interpretability, and generalizations.
Those ML models will be used to deepen our understanding of subgrid processes, and will be implemented as subgrid parameterizations or as bias corrections, in coarser resolution ocean (NEMO and MOM6) and coupled climate models (IPSLCM, CM4, CESM).</description></item><item><title>Alistair Adcroft</title><link>/team/alistairadcroft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/alistairadcroft/</guid><description>Princeton University, Affiliate NOAA-GFDL in Ocean division

Data assimilation produce a state estimate by merging a short-range dynamical forecast with observations. The analysis increment is the difference between the forecasted and corrected model state and thus contains information on the discrepancy between the model and observations. This gives us valuable information on physical processes that are systematically unaccounted for in traditional models.
Combined with analysis from high resolution simulations, this analysis will improve our understanding and representation of subgrid processes in global climate models, thereby reducing biases and providing more reliable climate projections.</description></item><item><title>Carlos Fernandez-Granda</title><link>/team/carlosferndandezgranda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>/team/carlosferndandezgranda/</guid><description>NYU, Courant Institute + Center for Data Science

New parametrizations will be implemented in ocean models and tested in multiple climate models.
The aim of the Machine Learning parameterizations for coarse-resolution models will be to achieve comparable accuracy to high-resolution global simulations or observations.

This work has 3 important implications: 1) a daily freeboard product allows them, for the first time, to assess radar freeboard (and ultimately sea ice thickness) variability on sub-weekly timescales &amp;ndash; it takes up to 1 month for each satellite to generate pan-Arctic coverage alone. 2) The method allows them to derive estimates of radar freeboard correlation length scales, which together with the daily freeboards, could be useful in sea ice data assimilation systems.</description></item><item><title> s2s challenge</title><link>/news/s2schallenge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>/news/s2schallenge/</guid><description>M²LInES PI Judith Berner is setting up a team to participate to the s2s challenge, which goal is to improve sub-seasonal to seasonal predictions using AI.
