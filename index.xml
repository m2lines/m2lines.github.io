Data from high-resolution simulation and observations. 2. Data resulting from model errors, also called data assimilation increments.
From high-resolution simulations and observational data We will diagnose small-scale physical processes such as:
Atmospheric convection and clouds (O&amp;rsquo;Gorman) Atmospheric boundary layer processes at the ocean and sea-ice interface (Gentine) Ocean mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (Abernathey) Ocean submesoscale processes (LeSommer) Ocean mesoscale momentum, energy and air-sea interactions (Zanna) Vertical mixing (Adcroft/Reichl) Sea-ice heterogeneity and its influence on air-sea-ice interactions (Holland) We will also learn from the data resulting from model errors.</description></item><item><title>Johanna Goldman</title><link>/team/johannagoldman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>/team/johannagoldman/</guid><description>NYU, Courant Institute

Our transformative methodology will rely on a range of ML algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks, equation-discovery), including with strict physical constraints, or with embeded physics for improved interpretability, and generalizations.
Those ML models will be used to deepen our understanding of subgrid processes, and will be implemented as subgrid parameterizations or as bias corrections, in coarser resolution ocean (NEMO and MOM6) and coupled climate models (IPSLCM, CM4, CESM).</description></item><item><title>Alistair Adcroft</title><link>/team/alistairadcroft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/alistairadcroft/</guid><description>Princeton University, Affiliate NOAA-GFDL in Ocean division

The aim of the Machine Learning parameterizations for coarse-resolution models will be to achieve comparable accuracy to high-resolution global simulations or observations.

This work has 3 important implications: 1) a daily freeboard product allows them, for the first time, to assess radar freeboard (and ultimately sea ice thickness) variability on sub-weekly timescales &amp;ndash; it takes up to 1 month for each satellite to generate pan-Arctic coverage alone.</description></item><item><title> s2s challenge</title><link>/news/s2schallenge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>/news/s2schallenge/</guid><description>M²LInES PI Judith Berner is setting up a team to participate to the s2s challenge, which goal is to improve sub-seasonal to seasonal predictions using AI.
