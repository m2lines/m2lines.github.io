M²LInES will be focusing on understanding these key climate processes using two types of data:
Data from high-resolution simulation and observations. Data resulting from model errors, also called data assimilation increments.</description></item><item><title>Johanna Goldman</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/team/johannagoldman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/team/johannagoldman/</guid><description>NYU, Courant Institute</description></item><item><title>Data Assimilation</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/research/research5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/research/research5/</guid><description>Atmospheric processes (Berner, Chapman) Ocean processes (Lu, Verma) Sea-ice parametrization (Bushuk, Gregory) Air-sea-ice fluxes (Berner, Holland, Bushuk, Chapman, Verma, Gregory) We will also learn from the data resulting from model errors, or data assimilation increments, illustrated in the figure below:</description></item><item><title>Developing new physics-aware machine learning tools</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/research/research2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/research/research2/</guid><description>Learning from the high resolution data, as well as from model errors (Data Assimilation Increments), we will develop Machine Learning algorithms that are physics- and scale-aware to accelerate climate science discovery .
Our transformative methodology will rely on a range of ML algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks, equation-discovery), including with strict physical constraints, or with embeded physics for improved interpretability, and generalizations.
Those ML models will be used to deepen our understanding of subgrid processes, and will be implemented as subgrid parameterizations or as bias corrections, in coarser resolution ocean (NEMO and MOM6) and coupled climate models (IPSLCM, CM4, CESM).</description></item><item><title>High-resolution simulations and observational data</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/research/research4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/research/research4/</guid><description>We will diagnose small-scale physical processes such as:

Climate models are complex mathematical representations of the physical processes happening in each of the climate system components: ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and land surface, as well as their interactions with each other.
Climate models divide the globe into three dimensional grid cells representing a specific location and elevation. The resolution of the models, their “level of detail”, is dependent on the size chosen for the grid cells: the smaller the grid size the higher the resolution.</description></item><item><title>Carlos

More specifically, a convolutional neural network is trained to predict the error statistics of a model ensemble, which will reduce the computational costs of the ensemble Kalman filter. This approach is tested in a quasi-geostrophic dynamic model to demonstrate its feasibility in more advanced weather and climate applications.</description></item><item><title>Multi-fidelity climate model parameterization by Mohamed Aziz Bhouri</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2310bhouri/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2310bhouri/</guid><description>In this preprint , Mohamed Aziz Bhouri and co-authors, including Pierre Gentine, developed a probabilistic multi-fidelity atmospheric parameterization for heat and moisture tendency.

The tendency adjustments are gleaned from the DART data assimilation system and a linear relaxation towards ERA-interim reanalysis. In this preprint , Will Chapman and Judith Berner show that the tendency adjustment significantly enhances the representation of the background state climatology for key prognostic and surface variables. Additionally, they show that stochastic tendencies are essential to accurately represent model variability of major atmospheric modes when making tendency adjustments.</description></item><item><title> Blog Post - A New Generation of Climate Models</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2309blogpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2309blogpost/</guid><description>M²LInES can now demonstrate the impact of data-driven Machine Learning parameterizations in global models! 🌎You can read about new gen climate models with AI in our blog post</description></item><item><title>New climate simulation model ensemble by Marika Holland</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2309holland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2309holland/</guid><description>Climate simulation uncertainties arise from internal variability, model structure, and external forcings. These uncertainty sources are difficult to disentangle across model generations because both model structure and external forcings typically change. This preprint , led by Marika Holland, presents new ensemble simulations which allow for the separation of uncertainty sources between two large ensembles (LEs) of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Importantly, we find a strong influence of historical forcing uncertainty in differences between CESM1-LE and CESM2-LE due to aerosol effects on simulated climate.</description></item><item><title>Understanding Extreme Precipitation Changes by Griffin Mooers</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2309mooers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2309mooers/</guid><description>Griffin Mooers is lead author in this preprint that leverages Variational Autoencoders on SPCAM5 output to examine the changes in the upper quantiles of precipitation between a control and warmed simulation.

Using a novel regional decomposition method, they showed that this relationship is entirely driven by mid-latitude ventilation processes and explains 70% of the variance in heat penetration depth across CMIP5/CMIP6 models.</description></item><item><title>ClimSim: LEAP publication</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2308bhouri/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2308bhouri/</guid><description>Several of M²LInES members and affiliates (Bhouri, Gentine, Zanna, Abernathey, Busecke, Mooers, Shamekh, and Yuval) have contributed to this LEAP paper presenting ClimSim, the largest-ever dataset designed for hybrid ML-physics research.

Existing models have a few ad hoc approximations which cause uncertainty in climate change simulations. In this breakthrough preprint , Aakash Sane and co-authors - Brandon Reichl, Alistair Adcroft, and Laure Zanna - replace such an approximation using data driven neural networks (NN), leading to improved physics in an ocean model simulation and a reduction of model bias in the Tropics.</description></item><item><title>Smart correction model for winter sky temperatures by Lorenzo Zampieri</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2306zampieri/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 09:29:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/news/2306zampieri/</guid><description>This study , led by Lorenzo Zampieri, and co-authored by Marika Holland, illustrates a novel method based on machine learning for reducing the systematic surface temperature errors that characterize multiple atmospheric reanalyses in sea-ice-covered regions of the Arctic under clear-sky conditions.
