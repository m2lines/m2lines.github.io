Welcome to M&#x00B2LInES: a large international collaborative project for improving climate projections using scientific machine learning. 

Our team includes scientists from New York University, Princeton, GFDL, Columbia, LDEO, NCAR, MIT, CNRS-IGE, and CNRS-IPSL. 
## Main Objectives
You can read more about how the tasks were split up on our [research page](https://m2lines.github.io/research) and learn about the leaders of each task on our [team page](https://m2lines.github.io/team).

#### 1: Observation Database
The first objective is ...

#### 2: Machine Learning
The second objective is to use machine learning to develop one- and three- dimensional data-driven gravity wave parametrizations to more accurately and efficiently represent ...
