##### Parameterization of moist process in the atmosphere
###### People involved: Paul Oâ€™Gorman, Griffin Mooers, Pierre Gentine
Much of the uncertainty in climate-model projections for surface precipitation and winds comes from the need to parameterize subgrid processes such as moist convection. We are developing and implementing new parameterizations for these processes using machine learning trained on high-resolution simulations. We aim to develop parameterizations that are robust, stable and physically consistent. See Yuval and Oâ€™Gorman 2020 and Yuval, Oâ€™Gorman and Hill 2021 for examples of these research projects.

##### Parameterization of the boundary layer
###### People involved: Alexander Connolly, Pierre Gentine
Boundary layer turbulence parameterization remains a major source of uncertainties in climate models, including for low-level clouds. We aim to develop a new approach to the boundary layer parameterization by targeting high-order closure terms in the turbulence representation, leveraging Large-Eddy Simulations and machine learning/symbolic regression.
