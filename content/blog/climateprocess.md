Despite drastic improvements in climate model development, current simulations have difficulty capturing the interactions among different processes in the atmosphere, oceans, and ice and how they affect the Earth’s climate; this can hinder projections of temperature, rainfall, and sea level.

**M²LInES will be focusing on understanding these key climate processes using two types of data:**

### High-resolution simulation and observations
* Atmospheric convection and clouds (O’Gorman, Mooers, Yuval) (see [Atmosphere](/blog/atmosphere))
* Atmospheric boundary layer processes at the ocean and sea-ice interface (Gentine, Connolly) (see [Atmosphere](/blog/atmosphere))
* Ocean mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (Balwada, Everard) (see [Ocean](/blog/ocean))
* Ocean submesoscale processes (Le Sommer, Barge) (see [Ocean](/blog/ocean))
* Ocean mesoscale momentum, energy and air-sea interactions (Zanna, Perezhogin) (see [Ocean](/blog/ocean))
* Vertical mixing (Adcroft, Reichl, Sane) (see [Ocean](/blog/ocean))
* Sea-ice heterogeneity and its influence on air-sea-ice interactions (Holland, Zampieri) (see [Sea-Ice](/blog/seaice))

### Data assimilation increments

[Data assimilation increments](/blog/dataassimilation) or DA are data resulting from model errors. We will be working on DA from 3 distinct parts of climate models:

* Atmospheric (Berner, Chapman)
* Ocean (Adcroft, Lu, Du)
* Sea-Ice (Adcroft, Bushuk, Gregory)


Below is a representation of the physical processes that will be studied by the team:
