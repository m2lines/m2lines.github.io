Ryan Abernathey, Arthur Guillaumin, Andrew Ross and Laure Zanna are co-authors of this [article](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03947) in JOSS presenting a new python package that allows scientists to perform spatial filtering analysis in an easy, flexible and efficient way. 
The package was initially developed as part of the Climate Process Team and will help further M²LInES goals of using data and ML to improve subgrid parameterizations.
