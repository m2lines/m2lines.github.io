**Nora Loose** is lead author of this [new paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022MS003518) - part of the Climate Process Team funded by NSF and NOAA - which compares two parameterizations (“GM90” and “GL90”) for the restratification effect of mesoscale eddies. The authors conclude that the less commonly used GL90 parameterization is a promising alternative to the popular GM90 scheme for isopycnal coordinate models, where it is more consistent with theory, computationally more efficient, easier to implement, and numerically more stable. **Alistair Adcroft** also contributed to the research.
