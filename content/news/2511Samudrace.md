Our latest **[blogpost](https://medium.com/@lz1955/samudrace-a-fast-accurate-efficient-3d-coupled-climate-ai-emulator-fcef3c60b079) dives into the story behind SamudrACE**, the first 3D AI ocean–atmosphere–sea-ice climate emulator. Developed in collaboration with **M²LInES, AI2, and NOAA GFDL**, SamudrACE marks a major milestone in the use of AI for climate science.

The post explores how the team built a model capable of simulating 1500 years of climate in just one day on a single GPU, making state-of-the-art climate modeling accessible to anyone, without the need for supercomputers or deep expertise in numerical modeling.
