This new [article](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-24-0258.1) explores the predictability of Antarctic sea ice, which varies by region and is influenced by ocean and atmospheric conditions. Using climate models, Marika Holland and co-authors, confirm that **sea ice changes can be predicted months in advance, with cycles of predictability linked to ice growth and retreat**: it remains predictable during growth, loses predictability when melting, and regains it as it reforms. Ocean temperature patterns near the ice edge play a key role, with variations across different regions. These ice changes also influence marine ecosystems by affecting light availability. Understanding these patterns can **improve climate predictions and support the management of the Southern Ocean’s biodiversity**.
