Autoregressive surrogate models (emulators) make fast predictions for dynamical systems but become unstable over time due to error buildup. This [study](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.18731), led by Chris Pedersen, introduces thermalization, a technique leveraging diffusion models to adaptively correct errors during inference. **By stabilizing predictions, it extends emulated rollouts of chaotic and turbulent systems by several orders of magnitude**. This breakthrough application of diffusion models enhances the utility of emulators, and can be applied to autoregressive models across science and engineering.
