Lorenzo Zampieri contributed to a [new paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-4687-2024), published in the Cryosphere and led by Francesco Cocetta at the CMCC Foundation, where the representation of Arctic sea ice in ocean and sea ice reanalyses is evaluated against observations from different sources. In the upcoming years, these reanalyses will play an important role when used as training datasets from data-driven models of sea ice, which motivates evaluation studies such as this one.
