Ocean models often struggle to represent how water mixes vertically, leading to persistent temperature and circulation biases. In this [preprint](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.176083747.76188196/v2), **Danni Du** and colleagues use machine learning (ML) to correct those biases by **learning directly from data assimilation outputs in NOAA’s GFDL SPEAR system**. When integrated into the ocean model, the ML corrections improved temperature and mixing accuracy, outperforming existing correction methods. Combining ML with traditional approaches produced even better results, leading to **more realistic sea surface temperatures and ocean structure**. This approach can be applied to other climate models, offering a powerful new way to make ocean simulations more accurate.
