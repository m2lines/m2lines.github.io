      <title> A Bayesian approach towards sea ice freeboard estimates - paper by Will Gregory</title>
      <link>/news/willgregorypaper/</link>

      <guid>/news/willgregorypaper/</guid>
      <description>Incoming M²LInES postdoc Will Gregory is the lead author in this new publication on using a Bayesian approach towards sea ice freeboard estimates from satellite observations.
This work has 3 important implications: 1) a daily freeboard product allows them, for the first time, to assess radar freeboard (and ultimately sea ice thickness) variability on sub-weekly timescales &amp;ndash; it takes up to 1 month for each satellite to generate pan-Arctic coverage alone.</description>
