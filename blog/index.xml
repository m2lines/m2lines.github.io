Atmosphere Parameterization of moist process in the atmosphere People involved: Paul Oâ€™Gorman, Griffin Mooers, Pierre Gentine Much of the uncertainty in climate-model projections for surface precipitation and winds comes from the need to parameterize subgrid processes such as moist convection. We are developing and implementing new parameterizations for these processes using machine learning trained on high-resolution simulations. We aim to develop parameterizations that are robust, stable and physically consistent.</description></item><item><title>Climate Model Development</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/climate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/climate/</guid><description>Status of our parametrizations as of Sept 2025
Comprehensive climate models typically include atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land components and the coupling between them. These models can also incorporate land ice, atmospheric chemistry and terrestrial and marine biogeochemistry, enabling carbon cycle simulations. Early climate models were developed in the 1970s and have increased in complexity over the years, with more process interactions, more sophisticated parameterizations of subgridscale processes, and higher spatial resolution being incorporated over time.</description></item><item><title>Coupled Physics</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/coupledphysics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/coupledphysics/</guid><description>The earth system is complex with many different distinct subsystems interplaying with each other. Our approach in modeling the earth system is generally to develop separate models for each component and to include additional couplers that model their interactions. For example, Earth System Models typically include models of:
Atmosphere Land Land Ice Ocean River Runoff Sea Ice Wave In addition to improving each component independently, it is also important to better understand and model the coupling of components.</description></item><item><title>Data Assimilation</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/dataassimilation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/dataassimilation/</guid><description>Climate models &amp; observations Climate models are powerful tools to simulate and predict the Earthâ€™s climate system, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t without flaws. Due to missing physics, imperfect parameterizations, and inaccuracies in the underlying numerics, climate models often show structural errors. On the other hand we have direct observations of the climate system. However, observations come with their own set of limitations. They have limited space and time coverage and also contain errors due to measurement noise.</description></item><item><title>Key Climate Processes</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/climateprocess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/climateprocess/</guid><description>Despite drastic improvements in climate model development, current simulations have difficulty capturing the interactions among different processes in the atmosphere, oceans, and ice and how they affect the Earthâ€™s climate; this can hinder projections of temperature, rainfall, and sea level.
MÂ²LInES will be focusing on understanding these key climate processes using two types of data:
High-resolution simulation and observations Atmospheric convection and clouds (Oâ€™Gorman, Mooers, Yuval) (see Atmosphere ) Atmospheric boundary layer processes at the ocean and sea-ice interface (Gentine, Connolly) (see Atmosphere ) Ocean mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (Balwada, Everard) (see Ocean ) Ocean submesoscale processes (Le Sommer, Barge) (see Ocean ) Ocean mesoscale momentum, energy and air-sea interactions (Zanna, Perezhogin) (see Ocean ) Vertical mixing (Adcroft, Reichl, Sane) (see Ocean ) Sea-ice heterogeneity and its influence on air-sea-ice interactions (Holland, Zampieri) (see Sea-Ice ) Data assimilation increments Data assimilation increments or DA are data resulting from model errors.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/machinelearning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/machinelearning/</guid><description>Machine learning methodologies, particularly neural networks, are computer algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. These algorithms are capable of learning from data, identifying patterns, and making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes organized into layers, including input, hidden, and output layers (see figure below). During training, they adjust the strength of connections between nodes, called weights, based on examples from a dataset, allowing them to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.</description></item><item><title>Ocean</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/ocean/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/ocean/</guid><description>Ocean modeling and turbulence Figure: The ocean circulation is composed of many coherent features distributed over a wide range of scales. Snapshot of surface relative vorticity (swirliness) from a global 1/10 degree simulation with MOM6, showing the presence of ocean eddies, sharp boundary currents, tropical instability waves, shelf circulations, etc.
The ocean is a turbulent fluid, in which motions on a wide range of scales â€“ from centimeters to thousands of kilometers â€“ interact and exchange energy.</description></item><item><title>Project Goals and Vision</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/projectgoals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/projectgoals/</guid><description>Project Goal We aim to reduce biases at the air-sea-ice interface in existing global climate models for reliable seasonal to multidecadal timescale projections, focusing on fundamental ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice processes. Two leading sources of errors contribute to climate model biases: missing processes and numerics. The missing or inadequate representation of multiscale ocean, sea-ice, and atmosphere processes (e.g., clouds, mixing, turbulence), are not resolved by the current generation of climate models due to computational limitations.</description></item><item><title>Sea Ice</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/seaice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/seaice/</guid><description>Sea Ice Figure: Snapshot of Arctic sea ice thickness (Greenland, Barents and Kara Seas) from a CM4 simulation (â…›-degree ocean and sea ice). The Fram strait (between Greenland and Svalbard) exports approximately 10% of the total Northern Hemisphere sea ice cover out of the Arctic basin annually.
Sea ice is the thin layer of frozen ocean that exists at the high latitudes, forming when ocean temperatures are sufficiently cooled by the atmosphere.</description></item><item><title>Developing new physics-aware machine learning tools</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/research2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/research2/</guid><description>Learning from the high resolution data, as well as from model errors (Data Assimilation Increments), we will develop Machine Learning algorithms that are physics- and scale-aware to accelerate climate science discovery .
Our transformative methodology will rely on a range of ML algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks, equation-discovery), including with strict physical constraints, or with embeded physics for improved interpretability, and generalizations.
Those ML models will be used to deepen our understanding of subgrid processes, and will be implemented as subgrid parameterizations or as bias corrections, in coarser resolution ocean (NEMO and MOM6) and coupled climate models (IPSLCM, CM4, CESM).</description></item><item><title>High-resolution simulations and observational data</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/research4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/research4/</guid><description>We will diagnose small-scale physical processes such as:
