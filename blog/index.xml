These algorithms are capable of learning from data, identifying patterns, and making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes organized into layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. During training, they adjust the strength of connections between nodes, called weights, based on examples from a dataset, allowing them to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.</description></item></channel></rss>
