Due to missing physics, imperfect parameterizations, and inaccuracies in the underlying numerics, climate models often show structural errors. On the other hand we have direct observations of the climate system. However, observations come with their own set of limitations. They have limited space and time coverage and also contain errors due to measurement noise.</description></item><item><title>Key Climate Processes</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/climateprocess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/climateprocess/</guid><description>Despite drastic improvements in climate model development, current simulations have difficulty capturing the interactions among different processes in the atmosphere, oceans, and ice and how they affect the Earthâ€™s climate; this can hinder projections of temperature, rainfall, and sea level. MÂ²LInES will be focusing on understanding these key climate processes using two types of data:
Data from high-resolution simulation and observations. Data resulting from model errors, also called data assimilation increments.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/machinelearning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/machinelearning/</guid><description>Machine learning methodologies, particularly neural networks, are computer algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. These algorithms are capable of learning from data, identifying patterns, and making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes organized into layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. During training, they adjust the strength of connections between nodes, called weights, based on examples from a dataset, allowing them to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.</description></item><item><title>Ocean</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/ocean/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/ocean/</guid><description>Ocean modeling and turbulence Figure: The ocean circulation is composed of many coherent features distributed over a wide range of scales. Snapshot of surface relative vorticity (swirliness) from a global 1/10 degree simulation with MOM6, showing the presence of ocean eddies, sharp boundary currents, tropical instability waves, shelf circulations, etc.
The ocean is a turbulent fluid, in which motions on a wide range of scales â€“ from centimeters to thousands of kilometers â€“ interact and exchange energy.</description></item><item><title>Project Goals and Vision</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/projectgoals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/projectgoals/</guid><description>Project Goal We aim to reduce biases at the air-sea-ice interface in existing global climate models for reliable seasonal to multidecadal timescale projections, focusing on fundamental ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice processes.
Two leading sources of errors contribute to climate model biases: missing processes and numerics. The missing or inadequate representation of multiscale ocean, sea-ice, and atmosphere processes (e.g., clouds, mixing, turbulence), are not resolved by the current generation of climate models due to computational limitations.</description></item><item><title>Sea Ice</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/seaice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/seaice/</guid><description>ðŸš§ Under Development ðŸš§</description></item><item><title>Developing new physics-aware machine learning tools</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/research2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/research2/</guid><description>Learning from the high resolution data, as well as from model errors (Data Assimilation Increments), we will develop Machine Learning algorithms that are physics- and scale-aware to accelerate climate science discovery .
Our transformative methodology will rely on a range of ML algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks, equation-discovery), including with strict physical constraints, or with embeded physics for improved interpretability, and generalizations.
Those ML models will be used to deepen our understanding of subgrid processes, and will be implemented as subgrid parameterizations or as bias corrections, in coarser resolution ocean (NEMO and MOM6) and coupled climate models (IPSLCM, CM4, CESM).</description></item><item><title>High-resolution simulations and observational data</title><link>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/research4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m2lines.github.io/blog/research4/</guid><description>We will diagnose small-scale physical processes such as:
